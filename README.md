# Chronostructure Law — Testing Run (Runs 1–31)

This repository contains the full reproducible pipeline for the *Chronostructure Law (CL)*, developed by Luthfi Muslihat.  
It spans *31 runs* from foundational schema checks to falsifiability dashboards, resonance maps, historical overlays, and cosmic drift animation.

Overview

- *Runs 1–4:* Foundations (schema validation, predictors, baselines)  
- *Runs 5–8:* Reproducibility & noise diagnostics  
- *Runs 9–14:* Dual timelines, coefficient drift, falsifiability overlays  
- *Runs 15–17:* Historical resonance (Egyptian & Islamic closure)  
- *Runs 18–20:* Planetary overlays (rotation + orbit)  
- *Run 21:* Closure lattice dashboard  
- *Run 22:* Falsifiability atlas (instability zones)  
- *Run 23:* Instability dashboard (synthetic drift)  
- *Run 24:* Noise resonance map (1%, 5%, 10%)  
- *Run 25:* Resonance spectrum (instability vs noise)  
- *Run 26:* Cosmic atlas remapping (CL units)  
- *Run 27:* Commensurability grid (near‑integer resonance)  
- *Run 28:* Drift heatmap (instability across runs)  
- *Run 29:* Historical closure overlay (Egyptian decans, Islamic cycles)  
- *Run 30:* Atlas export (capstone dashboard)  
- *Run 31:* Cosmic drift animation (closure collapse across epochs)
