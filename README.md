# Chronostructure Law — Full Validation & Testing Suite

This repository contains the *complete reproducible pipeline* for the Chronostructure Law (CL), developed by *Luthfi Muslihat*.  
It spans two major components:

1. *Full Validation Suite* — the 5‑Phase Protocol validating CL against General Relativity, ΛCDM cosmology, FRB dispersion, anisotropy, and strong lensing.  
2. *Testing Runs (1–31)* — extended reproducibility dashboards, resonance maps, historical overlays, and cosmic drift animations.

## 🚀 Full Validation Suite (5‑Phase Protocol)

1. *Cassini Limit (Solar System)*  
   CL reproduces General Relativity’s Shapiro delay in weak‑field conditions.

2. *Hubble Tension Resolution (Cosmology)*  
   CL unifies early (Planck: 67.4) and late (SH0ES: 74.0) H₀ values.  
   Converges to ~72 km/s/Mpc with ~0.4% discordance.

3. *Dark Energy Mimicry (Acceleration)*  
   Luminosity distance curves (SN Ia style).  
   CL “time drag” reproduces ΛCDM‑like acceleration without invoking Dark Energy.

4. *FRB Macquart Residuals (Structure Detection)*  
   Dispersion measure deviations reveal structural drag signatures.  
   Residuals show non‑random trends at high z.

5. *Anisotropy Sky Map (Directional Invariance)*  
   RA/Dec mapping of FRB excess DM/z.  
   Hotspots reveal anisotropy consistent with CL predictions.

6. *GEGD Protocol (Strong Lensing)*  
   Lenstronomy simulations of density‑dependent time delays.  
   CL predicts correlation between external convergence (κ_ext) and observed delays.
